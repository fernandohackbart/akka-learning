# akka-learning
Some (very) basic application to learn Akka Core concepts and deployment, everything is minimal learn the basci concepts and make it work...

This application is configured to be run as a container, please check the DC/OS (Vagrant) documentation/[dcos-vagrant.md](documentation/dcos-vagrant.md)

## Done research
* Akka HTTP routes
* Actor message with ActorRef 
* Marshal and unmarshal of JSON 
* Checking the packaging for Docker (sbt-native-packager) documentation/[sbt-package-docker.md](documentation/sbt-package-docker.md)

## Current research
* Running container on DC/OS
* Running container on Kubernetes
* Maybe I can run on Google/AmazonWS/Azure cloud?

## Next research
* Going back to Scala programming
    * Akka Streams
    * Akka FSM
    * Akka clusters
