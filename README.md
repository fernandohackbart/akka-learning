Some (very) basic application to learn Akka Core concepts and deployment, everything is minimal learn the basic concepts and make it work...

## Done research
* Akka HTTP routes
* Actor message with ActorRef 
* Marshal and unmarshal of JSON 
* Checking the packaging for Docker (sbt-native-packager) documentation/[sbt-package-docker.md](documentation/sbt-package-docker.md)
* Running `biosphere/akka-learning:0.0.1` container on DC/OS 
    * This application was configured to be run as a container
    * DC/OS (Vagrant) documentation/[dcos-vagrant.md](documentation/dcos-vagrant.md)

## Current research
* Running `biosphere/akka-learning:0.0.1` container on Kubernetes
* Maybe I can run on Google/AmazonWS/Azure cloud?

## Next research
* Going back to Scala programming
    * Akka Streams
    * Akka FSM
    * Akka clusters
