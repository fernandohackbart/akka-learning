# akka-learning
Some (very) basic application to learn Akka Core concepts and deployment, everything is minimal learn the basic concepts and make it work...

## Research done
* Akka HTTP routes
* Actor message with ActorRef 
* Marshal and unmarshal of JSON 
* Checking the packaging for Docker (sbt-native-packager) documentation/[sbt-package-docker.md](documentation/sbt-package-docker.md)
* Running `biosphere/akka-learning:0.0.1` container on DC/OS 
    * This application was configured to be run as a container
    * DC/OS (Vagrant) documentation/[dcos-vagrant.md](documentation/dcos-vagrant.md)

## Current research

## Next research
* Akka Persistence and recover
    * 
* Akka Streams
* Akka FSM
* Akka clusters

* Describe a basic application
    * Create a simple application that uses the learned technologies and makes some sense

* Running `biosphere/akka-learning:0.0.1` container on Kubernetes
    * Will hold a bit in the deployment and wati to have a more complex application that can be described as a POD
    * DC/OS x Kubernetes
	* https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/dcos/

* Maybe I can run on Google/AmazonWS/Azure cloud?
